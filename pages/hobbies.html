                I got into weightlifting during COVID because I was overweight and lost 40 pounds in my first 3 months. 
                Since then, the gym has become a regular part of my routine. I am proud to say that I got accepted into 
                the 1k club. Here are my personal records (PRs): <br> <br>

                I have enjoyed playing video games for as long as I can remember. In 2016, I bought a game called 
                Overwatch and started playing it. Over time, I kinda got good at the game, so when I heard my school
                would be holding tryouts for a team I signed up immediately. I made the team and eventually became the 
                team captain in my second year on the team. In college, I also made the team and served as the team captain.
                Unfortunately, I only ever won a single tournament, but I can brag that I was one of top 100 players in North 
                America. <br> <br>
