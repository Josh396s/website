                Hey! Looks like you were unfortunate enough to find my website. 
                Well now that you're here let me tell you a lil about myself.
                I'm Josh as you can tell by the title, I got my Bachelor's of 
                Science in Comptuer Science from UC Santa Cruz I'm currently 
                doing my Master's in Computer Science with a focus on Machine 
                Learning & AI at UC San Diego. I'm also a gym and food junkie, 
                I can speak for hours about food and love trying different 
                culture's food. Fun little fact about me, I was team captain 
                of two Esports team for the game Overwatch and was at one point 
                one of the top 100 players in North America.
